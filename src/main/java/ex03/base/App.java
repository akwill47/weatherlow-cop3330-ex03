/*Exercise 3 - Printing Quotes
        Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string. But sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks themselves by using escape characters.

        Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and author as shown in the example output.

        Example Output
        What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
        Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
        Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."
        Constraints
        Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
        If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, donâ€™t use it for this exercise. Use string concatenation instead.
        Challenge
        Modify this program so that instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you create a structure that holds quotes and their associated attributions and then display all of the quotes using the format in the example.
        An array of maps would be a good choice.*/
public class App {
    static Scanner in =  new Scanner(System.in);
    public static void main(String[] args){
        App myApp = new App();

        System.out.print("What is the quote? ");
        String quote = myApp.readInput();
        System.out.print("Who said it? ");
        String author = myApp.readInput();

        String finalOutput = myApp.finalOutput(quote,author);

        myApp.displayOutput(finalOutput);

    }
    private String readInput(){

        return in.nextLine();

    }
    private String finalOutput(String quote,String author){
        return author + " says, " + "\"" + quote + "\"";
    }

    private void displayOutput(String finalOutput){
        System.out.println(finalOutput);
    }
}
